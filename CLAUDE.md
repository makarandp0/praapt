Claude Guidance

Canonical instructions live in ./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md. If Claude does not automatically ingest this file, begin by asking:

"Please read ./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md first and follow its minimal, search‑first workflow."

Pointers
- Canonical doc: ./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Ignore hints: ./.llmignore
