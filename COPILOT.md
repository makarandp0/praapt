GitHub Copilot Guidance

Canonical instructions: read ./AGENTS.md first. Copilot Chat may not auto-read this; if not, start your session with:

"Copilot, read ./AGENTS.md and follow it to avoid scanning the full repo. Prioritize apps/*/src and skip node_modules and dist."

Key pointers
- Canonical doc: ./AGENTS.md
- Ignore hints: ./.llmignore (advisory)
