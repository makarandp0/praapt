GitHub Copilot Guidance

Canonical instructions: read ./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md first. Copilot Chat may not auto‑read this; if not, start your session with:

"Copilot, read ./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md and follow it to avoid scanning the full repo. Prioritize apps/*/src and skip node_modules and dist."

Key pointers
- Canonical doc: ./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Ignore hints: ./.llmignore (advisory)
